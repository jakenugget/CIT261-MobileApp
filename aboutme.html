  <h2>Jacob</h2>
  <h2>Verde</h2>
  <p>Hello everybody my name is Jacob Verde usually I just go by Jake, but it doesn’t matter to me. 
  The degree I am going for is CIT Computer Information Technology, I’ve got about 30 credits to go. 
  I currently work for the DOD and I love it. I want to continue my career in cyber security and 
  eventually I’d love to work from home. Life can be busy which puts most hobbies I would have on 
  the back burner. My favorite thing to do with my time is spend time with my one year old son 
  and my wife. I love sports and weightlifting however it’s very difficult to find time to play, 
  so I usually just watch sports when I can.</p>
  <p>My favorite part about BYUI is the instructors. Never in my life have I had so many teachers so 
  willing to help and so understanding, it makes pursuing my degree much easier. I am excited to 
  learn the basics of web development because it will help me understand possible vulnerabilities 
  in websites. I have been lucky enough to raised in the church my entire life which has been a 
  great blessing to me. My favorite scripture is Ether 12:27 which paraphrasing says if we put 
  trust in god he will make weak things become strong unto us. I have seen this a lot in my life 
  especially in my pursuit of education, which before college was never a priority or strong point. 
  Now I am lucky enough to be doing very well and nearing a bachelor degree.</p>
